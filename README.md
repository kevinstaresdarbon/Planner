# Planner
A online daily planner.


## Description

This webpage demonstrates my ability to use some javascript logic to dynamically generate html for an interactive day planner and utilize dayjs and bootstrap libraries to some small extent.  

Information can be put into the input fields in each hour block and saved to local storage for persistence by using the corresponding save button.
It only stores one day at a time in local storage and discards old information from past days upon loading the page.
